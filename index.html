  <p> 
    Every year, an estimated 100 billion items of clothing are manufactured, and another 92 billion are dumped into landfills and waste management services that have no way of sorting through or processing those textiles. Across Massachusetts, residents and businesses throw away 230,000 tons of textiles annually. More than 5% of waste delivered to combustion facilities were textiles, including towels, clothing, curtains, and other fabrics. Within the textiles being thrown away, around 85% of it could be recycled, reused, or reworn by someone else.

    <h1>Boston Ban</h1>
    <p> In November of 2022, the city of Boston and MASSDEP (Department of Environmental Protection) implemented their own textile waste ban, restricting the amount of clothing and mattresses filling dumps in the area. This is just one step in Boston’s zero-waste plan. In the ban, textiles are categorized as  “clothing, footwear, bedding, towels, curtains, fabric, and similar products, except for textiles that are contaminated with mold, bodily fluids, insects, oil, or hazardous substances.” For more information on what is considered ok to recycle and how to do so, visit https://tinyurl.com/deptextile.

  <h2> What does that mean for Boston Residents?
  </h2>
  &nbsp;
  <p> 
    The city of Boston, and other organizations such as PlanetAid, have textile donation bins placed all around the city and state for residents to drop off their clean, dry items. Most of these items are usable, so they are sorted and donated to second-hand stores around the state. Other options include taking your clothing straight to second-hand stores, such as Salvation Army, Goodwill, or Buffalo Exchange, with some even buying your items or giving you store-credit. Boston is also full of great locally owned thrift stores that not only take donations, but have fabulous clothes to buy instead of buying fast fashion. Check out the map below to see where the closet donation drop-off bin is to you!

    <h1> But what about all the fabric that cannot be reworn or recycled? What then?</h1>

  <div class="text">
    <center> <h1>GRAFF</h1></center>

    <p> GRAFF, a company founded by 5 Hult business school alums, is tackling this issue at the core; finding ways to reuse the unusable fabric sitting in our landfills. The five of them came together to compete for the Hult Prize, with this year's Prize topic being issues around sustainable fashion.  “GRAFF is composed of 5 founders that scream diversity in all aspects. The name itself is a representation of who we are Giulia Massaccesi (Italy), Rikita Lakdawala (India), Ana Maria Perez (Colombia), Francesco Ficorilli (Italy), and Francisco Da Silva (South Africa)” explained Rikita Lakdawala, who, herself, comes from a textile and garment manufacturing background back home in India. The others all have personal ties to the fashion industry and textile waste in their own ways. Ana in Columbia and Francisco from South Africa both lived around the textile landfills and had to deal with the repercussions of this in their community. Giulia and Francesco, who both hail from Italy, have seen the overproduction and overconsumption of clothing and leather on a European scale, but have also dealt with the plastic legislation in Italy, which is much stricter than in the U.S. With these personal backgrounds, and with some research and brainstorming, they all agreed it made sense to tackle all the excess at the end of the supply chain, after the textiles had made their way through manufacturing and the consumer markets. This forged a path to recycle the textiles into a new kind of material that could replace plastic in manufacturing clothes hangers."

  <h1> The Testing Phase</h1>
  <h2>“We did a lot of tests and research at the MIT Labs, well our engineer of the company, Julia, did. So we did a lot of tests at the MIT labs, and worked with UMass Lowell because they have a certain type of materials lab. We ran multiple things, checked and tested it for resistance and those kind of things, trying to calculate the amount of carbon emissions, ya know we did all of those things in the first good 3 or 4 months, and once we found something that worked, we just kept testing it to make it better and better” said Rikita Lakdawala</h2>
<p> They did their preliminary research at labs here in Boston, but then took the material testing abroad to Columbia where one of the team members is based. Metagene is the hub of textile and garment production in Latin America, and Ana, the lawyer, knew the market for manufacturing well. They decided this was the smart choice since it was not only cheaper, but the researchers there knew more about textile science than here in Boston. In Columbia, they took the material they had made in MIT and tested it even further and farther, to make it better and stronger, but also to  understand what it could and couldn’t do (testing the limitations). They were also trying to find what stuff they could make with this material instead of plastic, and it turns out their only limitation is food-grade plastic products. Everything else, from hangers, to chairs, to airplane interiors. that are made from plastics could be made from this textile recycle material they are calling "texterial".

    <h1>Texterials - limitations and the process</h1>
    <p> 
      Graff has partnered with Roberto Recycling & Disposal here in Boston, as well as constantly trying to expand their tie-ups with other companies, to produce the textile waste they need to make their texterial. One man's trash is literally their treasure. Then, it all gets sorted so wearable clothing items can make their way back into the community where they are donated to second hand stores. “If a garment is good, why would we shred it if someone can wear it!” Guilia, the chemists, exclaimed. And the best part, it doesn't matter what material the clothing items are, “We can input most kinds of textile, that's the special part, it doesn't matter if it's polyester or denim, it will work the same, it doesn’t affect the way the pellets are constructed.” The unusable items are then put into a shredder to break down the fibers before it gets turned into the texterial. And their only limitation, Guilia explains, is food-grade plastics. This will be one of the next onbstacles the group hopes to change, as they want nothing to be out of the boundaries of what they can make.

  “These sustainable hangers are aimed at disrupting the existing hanger industry that is currently responsible for 10 billion plastic hangers, and an equivalent of 83 million tons of CO2 annually. By switching to GRAFF hangers, a drastic reduction in carbon emissions can be achieved. Each plastic hanger is responsible for 120g of CO2, whereas a GRAFF hanger emits just 3g of CO2.” Francesco Ficorilli

   <h1> Next Steps & the Ultimate Goal</h1>
   <p>
    As places around the world, including Boston, are crackig down on plastic regulations, more and more manufactered won't be able to use as much plastic as they are now. “Europe is extremely strict about plastic regulations, they are banning plastic on multiple levels. The regulations, Boston has all these sudden imposing regulations.  So what is going to be the next best thing? It’s going to be something with GRAFF’s “texterial”, which can be used as pellets like plastic in the machines you are already using. We just need to tweak the settings a little to be able to use the texterial perfectly well, and then that's it. There is no switching cost for the manufacturer, we are just trying to make it as seamless as possible.” Rikita explained to me. By switching out regular plastic pellets to GRAFF's texterial pellets, they are not only saving the planet, but manufactering costs. 
   </p>
   &nbsp;
   <p> And their ultimate goal? working with clothing companies directly, reusing their unwanted fabrics to turn them into hangers to be on the racks in the stores. "That would be the dream" they almost all said in unison with optimistics smiles on their faces. There is not limit to color choice or mold, if widely producede and spread around the world, everythign (hopefully including food-grade plastic items) would transition into being made with texterial pellets. The team hopes to be up and functionally running by the end of next year, selling their hangers in retail stores and online.
